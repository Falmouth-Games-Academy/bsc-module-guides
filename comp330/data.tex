\def\introduction{This module allows you consolidate your multi-disciplinary collaborative game development experience to work on a substantial development project over the course of two study blocks. You will develop your knowledge of computing for games in a practical way using techniques and methods that help you to take a creative approach to building an innovative and marketable game.}

\def\moduleAims{
	{Consolidate your knowledge and experience of creating marketable games in a collaborative context.},
	{Apply knowledge and experience of computing for games as one part of a larger project.},
	{Demonstrate independence in identifying a non-trivial computing problem and working iteratively and collaboratively towards a computing solution.}}
	
\def\moduleLearningOutcomes{1,2,3,4,5,6}
	
\def\assessmentCriteria{
	{Apply computing principles and processes to produce collaboratively an effective computing solution of use within a game development context.},
	{Communicate clearly and appropriately when working in a group.},
	{Work iteratively on the basis of on-going evaluation in a collaborative context and analyse critically the strengths and weaknesses of your collaborative iterations.},
	{Create a solution for which there is a market and for which you can show need.},
	{Create an innovative solution tailored to a known market appropriate to platform.},
	{Understand and use effectively methods for organising and executing a game development project in a collaborative context. Show an understanding of how to plan, organise and execute a substantial, collaborative project.}}
